/**
 * This class represents a User in the application.
 * 
 * The class implements the UserDetails interface from Spring Security,
 * which is necessary for Spring Security to know how to authenticate and
 * authorize
 * a user in the system.
 * 
 * By implementing UserDetails, we provide essential user information such as:
 * - Username (typically email or ID)
 * - Authorities (roles or permissions)
 * - Account status (locked, enabled, expired, etc.)
 * 
 * This allows Spring Security to manage authentication, session management, and
 * security checks effectively. It also helps in securely storing user
 * credentials
 * and roles within the security context.
